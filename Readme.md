# Uber-Like App

This repository contains the codebase for an Uber-like application providing both delivery and cab services. The project uses modern technologies including Docker, Kubernetes, TypeScript for backend, React for frontend, GraphQL for API interactions, Redis for caching, Kafka for message brokering, and advanced routing algorithms.
